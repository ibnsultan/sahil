# sahil
Swahili Programming language written over Python
Sahil is an Implementation of BASIC programming language using python and swahili lexical terms, It is a sister language of swap(predecessor)

**Current State:** 
- uses a tree structure to do solve simple expressions
- It supports basic BODMAS operations
- variable declaration, initiation and redeclaration
- The use of operators in expressions
- The use of boolean expressions
- Implement the basic control structure using the conditional and iteration statements
- Functions declaration and function calls 

## To DO  : `now dealing with the list`
- [X] lexer
- [x] parser
- [x] Interpreter
- [x] Variables
- [x] Operators
  - [x] Logical operators
  - [x] Comparison operators
- [ ] Control Structures
  - [x] if-else condition
  - [x] for and while loop
  - [ ] Return, Continue and Break
- [ ] Functions
  - [x] User-made functions
  - [ ] Built-in functions
- [x] Strings
- [ ] multilines statements
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Run statements and Comments

## INTERFACE
Sahil uses a CLI interface, as for now only the Read-evaluate-print-loop(**Repl**) mode is supported, 
Repl enable you to interactively execute sahil's code line by line without requiring to write a entire script file
